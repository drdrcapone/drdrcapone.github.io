            <p>Are you being weighed down by difficult emotions? Do you struggle to forget memories of something from your past? Maybe you have trouble resisting certain thoughts or unhealthy behaviors? As part of a couple, perhaps you have felt misunderstood or unheard? If any of these situations sound familiar, come talk to me.</p>
            <p>Together we will work on strategies that allow you to address the causes of your problems and build lasting solutions. You will find my approach to be humanistic, empowering, and collaborative. In my 20 years of practice, I have worked with adults in couples or individual therapy needing help with communication and conflict resolution, stress and anger management, OCD and panic disorders, PTSD and complex PTSD, domestic violence, survivors of abuse, post-partum depression, and many more. My specialties include Anxiety, Trauma, and Compulsive Behaviors, and approaches to find solutions include DBT, EMDR, IFIO (Intimacy from the Inside Out), and IFS (Internal Family Systems).</p>
            <p>I have a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, Master's degrees in Human Development and Family Counseling, and I am a Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC) in Colorado. After 20 years of counseling adults in therapy, I decided to form my own private practice, HSChubert Counseling, LLC. The focus at my private practice is a holistic approach, utilizing the different techniques described above, to grow in ourselves and our relationships. It would be my honor to work with you.</p>
            <p>I do in-person and telehealth appointments and I specialize in the following:</p>
