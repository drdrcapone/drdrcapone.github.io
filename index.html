                <p> My name is Holly Schubert, and I am a Licensed Professional Counselor in Littleton, Colorado specializing in trauma therapy, EMDR, and Internal Family Systems. I founded my private practice in 2018, but I have worked as an LPC since 1991. Over more than 20 years, it has been an honor to serve a variety of clients in individual and group therapy. I have experience working with adults on concerns ranging from anxiety and depression to stress and anger management. I am currently transitioning my practice to self-pay only, so I am booking appointments directly either through Psychology Today or my Google Voice phone number. If you think I would be a good fit to help you in therapy, please make an appointment below. Thanks for stopping by!</p></div>
