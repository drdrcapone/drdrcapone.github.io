              <h4>My First Blog Post: The Website is Live!</h4>
                  <h5>I discuss beginning my website, December 9, 2024</h5>
                    <p>Hello everyone, and welcome to my first blog post! I am so thrilled to have a space where I can share the experience of being a Licensed Professional Counselor with clients, other professionals, and the world at large.</p>
                    <p>My website has been live for the last few days. It required a lot of work on the part of my son, Cam, who has been working on optimizing the site for mobile use and search engine access. I am happy to say that my website is now <strong>open for business!</strong></p>
                    <p>I plan on using this site to expand my private practice and have a convenient place to keep resources for my clients and the public. Over time, I am hoping this site will serve as a link between my other therapist profiles and allow me to reach a larger audience of people that I can help.</p>
                    <p>If you are one of the first to see this site and feel like my services are a good fit for your needs, please don't hesitate to visit my contact page to the left and set up an appointment. I would be honored to work with you!</p>
